/**
 * App-level keepalive loop. Defense-in-depth against silent SDK / network
 * issues that the SDK's internal ping watchdog might miss.
 *
 * Patterns borrowed from notebook bot's `auto_reconnect`:
 *
 *  1. 15s setInterval — independent of SDK's pingInterval (server-pushed,
 *     typically 30-60s). We catch issues earlier and from a different angle.
 *
 *  2. Wake-up detection — if the timer was skipped for > SLEEP_DETECT_MS, the
 *     machine likely slept (laptop lid / hibernate / suspend). Reset counters
 *     and bail out for this tick: don't trust state captured pre-sleep.
 *
 *  3. Timer storm guard — when machine wakes, multiple intervals can fire
 *     back-to-back. If less than TIMER_STORM_GUARD_MS since last tick, skip.
 *
 *  4. HTTP probe — before force-reconnecting, hit the Feishu domain over HTTP.
 *     If even HTTP can't reach, it's a network-level outage, not a WS issue,
 *     and force-reconnect won't help. Avoid log spam.
 *
 *  5. Counter-based debounce — only force-reconnect after DEAD_THRESHOLD
 *     consecutive ticks confirm WS is not connected. Defends against
 *     transient state-read races during reconnect.
