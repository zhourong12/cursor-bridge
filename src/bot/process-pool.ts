/**
 * FIFO concurrency cap for claude runs. Especially useful in topic-group
 * scenarios where each topic spawns its own run — without a cap, a single
 * busy group could trivially explode to dozens of concurrent claude
 * subprocesses, drowning RAM and Anthropic API rate limit.
 *
 * Use:
 *   const pool = new ProcessPool();
 *   const release = await pool.acquire();
 *   try { ... } finally { release(); }
 *
 * The cap is read fresh each `acquire()`, so `/config maxConcurrentRuns`
 * takes effect for the next run that asks for a slot.
